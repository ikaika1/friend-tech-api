## 0. Introduction

Registration or Authentication is not implemented ATM.

## 1. How They Made

The backend seems made by Privy but only in the phone verification they're using it as a wrapper.  
Maybe We will be Arkham'd up.

## 2. Vulnerabilities

1. In verification, rate limits are poorly implemented in SMS authentication thus bypass is possible.
2. You can redeem the invite code as much as you want to deplete since there is no flag.

## 3. Fun Facts

1. You don't have to deposit for debugging since all validation is client-side.
2. All endpoint is from kosetto.com which is a dead NFT project.
3. You can check the latest registered users to buy tokens ASPA, so basically, this platform is now almost f\*\*\*ed by a bot.
