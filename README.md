## 0. Introduction

Registration or Authentication is not implemented ATM.

## 1. How They Made

The backend seems made by Privy but only in the phone verification they're using it as a wrapper.  
Maybe We will be Arkham'd up.

## 2. Vulnerabilities

1. Rate limits are poorly implemented in SMS authentication thus bypass is possible.
2. Invite codes are redeemable as much as you want to deplete since there is no flag.

## 3. Problem

You can check the latest registered users to buy tokens ASAP, so basically, this platform is now almost f\*\*\*ed by a bot.

## 4. Fun Facts

1. You don't have to deposit for debugging since all validation is client-side.
2. All endpoint is from kosetto.com which is a dead NFT project.
3. 08/20/2023 (JTC). All Japanese international phone numbers are temporarily blacklisted because of me.
4. Now [all public users information is exposed](https://gist.github.com/banteg/76d141fea2e658e5d2854944342f2d3d) by [banteg](https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1693547023977382277)
